`Vinxi` is a full stack JavaScript SDK to build apps and frameworks of all kinds with your own opinions. Our only opinion is that we like JavaScript/TypeScript and we want to see it eat the world. It is powered by some of the most foundational tools in the JavaScript ecosystem: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) (and many other tools contributed by the community).

Being a SDK, `vinxi` is a collection of primitives that you can bend to your will to compose your own full stack applications and frameworks. You might be coming here from a specific context and use case. So depending on your use case, you can choose where to start your journey:

- [Create a new app with Vinxi](./create-your-first-app.md)
- [Add to an existing Vite app](./add-to-existing-vite-app.md)
- [Create your own framework with Vinxi](./build-your-own-framework.md)

But if you don't want to commit to any of those and just want to look around, you can start by reading:

- [Why we built Vinxi](./why-vinxi.md)
- The core concepts of Vinxi: [App](/api/app) and [Router](/api/router)
- [Our philosophy behind our decisions](./philosophy.md)
